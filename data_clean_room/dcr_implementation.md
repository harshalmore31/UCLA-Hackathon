# Implementation of DCR (Data Clean Room)

## Secure Multiparty Data Sharing with Confidential Computing

Data Clean Rooms provide a secure space for companies to collaborate on data analysis without revealing private user information.
Ideal for scenarios where multiple parties need to combine data for better insights.
Publishers and advertisers can improve ad targeting while maintaining user privacy.
By anonymizing data within a controlled environment, Data Clean Rooms reduce privacy risks and ensure compliance with regulations.
This approach allows for richer data analysis and more accurate models.
While keeping user data confidential, companies can gain valuable insights.
Data Clean Rooms strike a balance between data utility and privacy.
Enabling collaboration and innovation while respecting user trust.


Confidential computing uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) like Intel® TDX and SGX to create secure enclaves within processors. 
These enclaves protect data confidentiality and integrity, even if the system is compromised.
Imagine a locked vault inside your computer for processing sensitive information.
This technology is ideal for Virtual Machines (VMs), enabling secure data processing on shared hardware.
It's like having multiple secure computers running on one physical machine.
Secure enclaves ensure your data remains protected throughout processing.

Confidential computing relies on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) built into modern processors like Intel® SGX and TDX. These TEEs act like secure vaults within the processor, protecting data confidentiality and integrity even in a compromised system.

Here's how to achieve confidential computing:
- Leverage cloud platforms or hardware that supports TEEs.
- Develop your application to utilize TEE libraries (e.g., Intel SGX SDK).
- Design your code to process sensitive data within the secure TEE enclave.
- TEEs handle computations, keeping your data encrypted and isolated from the rest of the system.


Cloud Confidential VMs offer a simpler approach to confidential computing compared to local setups. Here's why:

- Pre-configured Environment: Cloud providers manage the TEE infrastructure, eliminating the need for local installation and configuration of TEE libraries.
- Scalability and Flexibility: Cloud VMs offer easy scaling based on your needs, while local setups might require additional hardware investment.
- Security Expertise: Cloud providers have expertise in securing their infrastructure, potentially enhancing overall security compared to a local environment.
While local setups offer more control, cloud Confidential VMs provide a quicker and potentially more secure option for leveraging TEEs.

Using Azure Cloud Confidential VM ?
- Pre-built Security: Utilize pre-configured VMs with built-in TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) technology like Intel SGX or AMD SEV-SNP.
- Simple Setup: Skip local TEE library installation and configuration complexities.
- Secure Enclave: Isolate sensitive data processing within the secure enclave of the TEE, protecting confidentiality and integrity.
- Scalability: Easily scale your resources up or down as needed based on your workload.
- Cloud Expertise: Benefit from Microsoft's security expertise for a potentially more secure environment.
